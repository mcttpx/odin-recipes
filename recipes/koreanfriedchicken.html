    <li>Chicken wings (wings and drumettes)</li>
    <li>Cornstarch</li>
    <li>Garlic powder</li>
    <li>Baking powder</li>

    <li>Combine all glaze ingredients into a pan and bring to a
        boil and then lower to a simmer until sauce becomes slightly thick.</li>
    <li>Pat chicken dry and season very lightly with salt and garlic powder, there is plenty of salt in the soy sauce</li>
    <li>Place all the dry ingredients in a plastic bag and seal and shake to dredge our chicken</li>
    <li>Tap off excess cornstarch, and prepare to double fry. Oil is ready when a chopstick is placed in inside the oil bubbles.</li>
    <li>The goal is to double fry, so fry for 6-8 minutes and let rest on a wire rack, then fry for another 4-5.</li>
