Started on 2/19/24 and finished on 2/20/24, from the foundations course of TOP

This is going to be a bare-bones HTML website that consists of recipes and links to those recipes. 

This is for practice on foundational HTML, good git commit etiquette and forming good developing habits for real-world application. 


Project Reflection:

After finishing this project, I found myself a lot more confident in HTML for building the spine of a website and using git for version control. I did enjoy doing it and it was a nice way to learn. Thanks TOP!
